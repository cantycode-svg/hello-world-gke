# hello-world-gke

Hello world application deployed to Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine

## Prerequisites

#### Google Cloud SDK

This demo application will be deployed to Google Cloud Platform. As such, you will need a Google Cloud account in order to deploy this to your own project.

You can click [here](https://cloud.google.com/free) to create a Google Cloud account and receive $300 in promotional credits.

> Note: This demo exercise will cost money to run, so it is highly recommended to sign up for the $300 free credit. While Google Cloud does have an "always free" tier, this will not completely cover the resources used for this exercise.

After signing up, a billing account called "My Billing Account" with $300 promotional credits should have been created for you. This account will be used for the duration of this exercise.

The next step is to download the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/). This tool will allow you to obtain credentials for your Google account that will be provided to the tools / scripts used to provision this environment. It will also allow you to query for information about your Google Cloud project(s) using a command line interface.

Once your `gcloud` CLI is set up, the following command can be used to authenticate yourself with your Google account:

```bash
$ gcloud auth login
```

Optionally, you can also run the following command to authenticate any applications that you run locally to use your Google account when communicating to Google APIs:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

#### Docker

The only other prerequisite required for this exercise is Docker. While this exercise takes advantage of several different tools to provision infrastructure, such as Terraform, Helm, and the Kubernetes CLI, each of these tools will be wrapped within a Docker image that can be built and used locally.

## Deploying the exercise

The following command can be used to deploy this exercise:

```
$ make up
```

This command will build the image used for this exercise, and use it to run `terraform`, `helm`, and `kubectl` to provision the environment for you.

When you run this, you will be prompted to enter a value for your Google Cloud Project ID. This is a string value that must be unique across all of Google Cloud.

You will also be prompted to type the string `yes` during the `terraform apply` step.

## Cleaning up

The following command can be used to clean up all resources deployed within this exercise:

```
$ make down
```

You will be prompted to enter the string `yes` to confirm that you want to destroy the resources provisioned during this exercise.

## Monitoring Setup

This repository includes configuration for deploying a comprehensive monitoring stack using **kube-prometheus** to your GKE cluster. The monitoring stack includes:

- **Prometheus** - Metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana** - Visualization and dashboards  
- **Alertmanager** - Alert routing and management
- **Node Exporter** - Hardware and OS metrics
- **Kube State Metrics** - Kubernetes object state metrics

For detailed setup instructions, manifest files, and deployment steps, see the [monitoring/README.md](monitoring/README.md) documentation.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Copy manifests from kube-prometheus repository
git clone https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus.git /tmp/kube-prometheus
cd /tmp/kube-prometheus && git checkout release-0.16
cd /path/to/hello-world-gke
cp -r /tmp/kube-prometheus/manifests/setup monitoring/
mkdir -p monitoring/manifests
cp /tmp/kube-prometheus/manifests/*.yaml monitoring/manifests/

# Deploy to your GKE cluster
kubectl apply --server-side -f monitoring/setup
kubectl wait --for condition=Established --all CustomResourceDefinition --namespace=monitoring
kubectl apply -f monitoring/manifests/
```

See the [monitoring README](monitoring/README.md) for complete instructions, troubleshooting, and GKE-specific guidance.

## Tools used

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) - used to provision and configure all of the Google Cloud infrastructure. The code for this can be found in the `tf` folder.
* [Helm](https://helm.sh/) - used to deploy the demo application and the [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) and [nginx-ingress](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/nginx-ingress) charts.
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) - used to interact with the provisioned Kubernetes cluster
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) - used to parse JSON output from various commands

## Helm charts used

* [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) - used to create a CA and SSL certificate to enable HTTPS communication with our app.
* [nginx-ingress](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/nginx-ingress) - used to enable ingress into our cluster using the Ingress API. This ingress controller consumes the certificate created by cert-manager and handles SSL termination for our application.

## Demo application

The application that will be deployed to your Kubernetes cluster during this exercise is a Node.js based app that returns a JSON payload at `/`. The source code can be found within the `app` folder. This code has already been packaged into a Docker container that can be found at [mrparkers/hello-world-gke](https://hub.docker.com/r/mrparkers/hello-world-gke).

The helm chart used for this application can be found within the `k8s/app` folder.
